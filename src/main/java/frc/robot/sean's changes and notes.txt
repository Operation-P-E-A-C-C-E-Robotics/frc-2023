Added libraries from last year

Started robotState
    not finished - needs Logan's stuff

Started field points
    not finished! needs actual points

DID A LOTTA STUFF

TODO LIST PRE-REVERE:
[todo] re-zero cancoders as accurately as possible
[todo] ensure all motors and air cylinders are going the correct direction
    [todo] the intake gripper is backwards
[meh] measure actual max speeds for reference and eventual usage
[todo] arm gravity feedfoward
[todo] ensure accurate gear ratios and units for everything
    [todo] fix drivetrain units
    [todo] fix wrist units
[todo] improve current setpoints
[todo] fix drivetrain shifters
[todo] tune current autos
[todo] get odometry tracking accurately
    [todo] tune apriltag rejection and standard devs.
[todo] odometry-based auto cube scoring
[todo] fix my nice drive mode
    [todo] remap buttons for new joysticks
[todo] auto alignment for intaking
[todo] vision tape tracking auto cone scoring
[todo] tune path following
[todo] better autos
[todo] auto tipped cone intaking (very complex)
[todo] whatever else i've forgotten or discover

STUFF I'LL forget to do at comp:
 [ok] take wrist out of set position, make it make sense
 - add more gravity feedforward
    [ok] pivot
    - arm?
 [it's wrong] remember about the extra *10 for drivetrain velocity - make sure that's right
 [ok] test joystick twist quickturn
 - label reset buttons on driver joystick

TESTING TODO LIST 3/6:
 - presets
 - presets with turret.
 - preset with gamepiece targeting
 - fancy stuff

TODO as of 2/25:
 - Get drivetrain shifting like butter
 - Vision-based cone placement
 - test cube/cone placement
 - cubes/cones from either camera??
 - test all the position controllers
 - auto modes
 - actual UI button bindings
 - tune drivetrain constants
 - the whole endEffector
    - color sensor
