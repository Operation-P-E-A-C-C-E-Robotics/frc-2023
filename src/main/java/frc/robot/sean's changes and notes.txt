Added libraries from last year

Started robotState
    not finished - needs Logan's stuff

Started field points
    not finished! needs actual points

DID A LOTTA STUFF

ROBOT DEFAULT BEHAVIORS:
- intake:
    - rest open after ejecting, closed after intaking
    - always close intake when gamepiece detected
    - always open when intaking, ejecting
- supersystem:
    - slight angle in anticipated direction of travel, turret zeroed, when in center of field
    - angle towards targets in community
    - angle towards pickup when near substation

CYCLE PATTERN:
1. robot drives to substation
    - pivot angles towards substation once in zone
    - intake resting open
    - turret zeroes till near substation
2. robot intakes game piece (intake button pressed)
    a. targets substation
    b. reaches out to grab
    c. intake closes
    d. arm retracts
3. robot drives to place
    - pivot angles towards place once in zone
    - intake resting closed
    - turret zeroes till near place
4. robot places game piece (place button pressed)
    a. targets place
    b. reaches out to place
    c. intake opens
    d. arm retracts

FINAL CONTROL SCHEME PLAN:
- place
    - low
    - mid
    - high
- intake
    - floor
    - single substation
    - double substation

HOLY FUK ITS REVERIE TODO:
[OK] make sure wrist angle init and arm soft limits working (pre inspection)
[todo] fix turret soft limit
[OK??????????????????] add place to auto balance
[todo] tune drivetrain
[OK] better soft limits so can palce high cones



TODO LIST PRE-REVERE:
[OK] re-zero cancoders as accurately as possible
[OK] speed up shit as much as possible
[OK] improve turret accuracy
[todo] color sensor
[todo] mode selector (cube/cone)
[todo] ensure all motors and air cylinders are going the correct direction
    [todo] the intake gripper is backwards
[todo] arm gravity feedfoward
[todo] ensure accurate gear ratios and units for everything
    [OK] fix drivetrain units
    [todo] fix wrist units
[OK] improve current setpoints
[OK] fix drivetrain shifters
[OK] tune current autos
[OK] get odometry tracking accurately
    [OK] tune apriltag rejection and standard devs.
[OK] odometry-based auto cube scoring
[OK] fix my nice drive mode
[todo] remap drive buttons for new joysticks
[todo] auto alignment for intaking
[todo] vision tape tracking auto cone scoring
[todo] tune path following
[todo] better autos
    [todo] 25 pt auto
    [todo] 2 game piece auto
[todo] auto tipped cone intaking (very complex)
[todo] whatever else i've forgotten or discover

STUFF I'LL forget to do at comp:
 [ok] take wrist out of set position, make it make sense
 - add more gravity feedforward
    [ok] pivot
    - arm?
 [it's wrong] remember about the extra *10 for drivetrain velocity - make sure that's right
 [ok] test joystick twist quickturn
 - label reset buttons on driver joystick

TESTING TODO LIST 3/6:
 - presets
 - presets with turret.
 - preset with gamepiece targeting
 - fancy stuff

TODO as of 2/25:
 - Get drivetrain shifting like butter
 - Vision-based cone placement
 - test cube/cone placement
 - cubes/cones from either camera??
 - test all the position controllers
 - auto modes
 - actual UI button bindings
 - tune drivetrain constants
 - the whole endEffector
    - color sensor
